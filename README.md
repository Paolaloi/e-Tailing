This study focuses on the changes internet brought in the retailing sector. The popularity and massive use of e-commerce has radically transformed consumer behavior. But what are the consequences for companies? \n

The results of these analyses will then be compared to the investments made by companies in the economy and internal assets, differentiating between companies that have adopted a business plan focused entirely on e-commerce and those that use a mix of online and offline. \n

Most of the data will be time series in the period between 2015 and 2023, with some forecasts up to 2027. Most data are . The method applied is based on the use of data visualization techniques and statistics in R to fully understand the data. In addition, the implementation of detailed visualizations, including comparative tables, pie charts, and histograms, will help answer the questions of this study.
