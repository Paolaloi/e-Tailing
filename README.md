## The impact of the internet in the retailing

In recent decades the pervasiveness of information and communication technologies (ICT) have changed human life in all its forms, in semantic and prasseological terms. Political, social and economic changes have led to an inevitable change in the balance in society, pushing for a socio-economic reorganization of behaviour patterns.
This study aims to show what changes internet has brought in the retailing sector. The popularity and massive use of e-commerce has radically changed consumer behaviour. But what are the consequences for companies?
I will analyze companies' profit ratios from a worldwide perspective, subsequently looking at growth prospects region by region. The results of these analyses will then be compared to the investments made by companies in the economy, differentiating between companies that have adopted a business plan focused entirely on e-commerce and those that use a mix of online and offline. 
Based on the results, an attempt will be made to assess the impact on companies that have preferred to rely on retailing in physical stores.
