## The impact of the internet in the retailing

In recent decades the pervasiveness of information and communication technologies have changed human life in all its form, changing the balance in society, pushing for a socio-economic reorganization of behavior patterns.


This study focuses on the changes internet brought in the retailing sector. The popularity and massive use of e-commerce has radically transformed consumer behavior. But what are the consequences for companies?


I will analyze companies' profit ratios from a worldwide perspective looking at growth prospects region by region. The results of these analyses will then be compared to the investments made by companies in the economy and internal assets, differentiating between companies that have adopted a business plan focused entirely on e-commerce and those that used a mix of online and offline.


The dataset used is retrieved from Statista. Most of the data will be time series in the period between 2015 and 2023, with some forecasts up to 2027. The method applied is based on the use of data visualization techniques and statistics in R to fully understand the data. The implementation of detailed visualizations, including comparative tables, histograms and timeseries will help answer the questions of this study.
